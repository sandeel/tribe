RequirementÂ Specification: Tribe
================================

# Overview

Tribe is an application for efficient families.

Each member of the family uses Tribe. Family members complete daily tasks to earn points which unlock rewards. Achievements can also be unlocked by users which earn more points.

## The Problem
* Kids need motivation to do homework and do tasks like cleaning their bedrooms
* Families are busy and find it hard to keep track of what other family members are doing and when
* Family members spend their days in different locations

## Aims of Tribe

**Motivation**
Create motivation for family members to work together on completing day-to-day tasks.

**Schoolwork**
Remind and encourage kids to complete homework.

**Accountability**
Allow parents to check that kids' homework has been done. Make sure everybody knows the dog has already been walked and fed.

**Family Interaction**
Encourage the family to spend time together and co-operate.

**Fun**
Give a sense of satisfaction and joint achievement and add a fun element to day-to-day tasks.

# How it works

Each member of the family who is signed up to Tribe becomes a "tribe member".

A parent, (or both parents, or even an older child or child minder) becomes the "tribe leader".

## Tasks

Tribe leaders create tasks.

Tasks can be once-off or recurring, eg. daily tasks ("do homework") or weekly tasks ("take out bins").

Tribe members complete tasks, and mark them as "done" using either the web interface or mobile app. Optionally a photo can be uploaded as proof that the task has been completed.


## Points

A Tribe Leader confirms that the task has been done and the points are awarded to the Tribe as a whole.

The accumulated points are visible to all tribe members.


## Rewards

If the tribe scores enough points in a given week, rewards are unlocked. Rewards are in "levels" eg., the Level 1 rewards might be unlocked after 100 points, Level 2 after 200, and so on.

Rewards are set by a tribe leader, and are specific to tribe members. For example, for parents the Level 1 reward might be a bottle of wine or cinema trip. For the older kids, the equivalent reward might be pocket money or phone top-up. For the youngest kid, it might be sweets. It is up to the tribe leader to ensure the rewards are roughly equal in value. All tribe members can view what rewards (for both themselves and other tribe members) are available for each level on a given week.

Tribe has a selection of default rewards to choose from, however the Tribe leaders have the option to customise the rewards.

Sample rewards for kids are

* amounts of pocket money (a multiplier system is available to award appropriate levels of pocket money based on the kids' ages)
* phone top-up credit
* presents (eg. a toy, new phone)


### Achievements
Extra points can be earned when a family member earns an achievement.

An achievement something remarkable that a tribe member did, such as completing a task x number of days in a row, completing a large number of tasks in a small space of time, and so on.

Tribe leaders create achievements but there are some defaults already created.

Achievements can be won more than once by the same person.

Gaining an achievement puts a badge on the tribe member's profile page.


### Categories
Tasks can fit into a category.

Information about how many points have been scored in a certain category are available, giving the Tribe an idea of where they are doing well and where improvements are needed.

Tribe provides several categories by default:

* Household
* Diet
* Fitness
* Pets
* Learning and School
