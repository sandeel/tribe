# Sprint 3 (26th Jan 2015 - 08th Feb 2015)

## 2015-01-26
* Created CheckIn class. There will now be no TaskTemplate, instead the Task will be a monolithic object which has available times and a CheckIn will refer to an instance of marking a task as done. This is to give more flexibility to different types of tasks eg. family dinners.


## 2015-01-28
* Added a "Check In" button to tasks which creates an instance of a check in for a user on that task and awards points. This uses the API in the background.
