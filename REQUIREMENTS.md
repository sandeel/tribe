# Overview

Tribe is an application for efficient families.

Tribe is a web-based application which all family members use. Family members complete daily tasks to earn points which unlock rewards.

The Tribe project aims:

## Motivation
Create motivation for family members to work together on completing day-to-day tasks.

## Schoolwork
Remind and encourage kids to complete homework.

## Accountability
Allow parents to check that kids' homework has been done. Make sure everybody knows the dog has already been walked and fed.

## Family Interaction
Encourage the family to spend time together and co-operate.

## Fun
Give a sense of satisfaction and joint achievement and add a fun element to day-to-day tasks.

## How it works

Each member of the family who is signed up to Tribe becomes a "Tribe Member".

A parent, (or both parents, or even an older child or child minder) becomes the "Tribe Leader".

Tribe Leaders create tasks.

Tribe Members complete tasks, and mark them as "done" using either the web interface or mobile app.

A Tribe Leader confirms that the task has been done and the points are awarded to the Tribe. The accumulated points are visible to all tribe members.

If the tribe scores enough points in a given week, rewards are unlocked. Rewards are in "levels" eg., the Level 1 rewards might be unlocked after 100 points, Level 2 after 200, and so on.

Rewards are set by a tribe leader, and are specific to tribe members. For example, for parents the Level 1 reward might be a bottle of wine or cinema trip. For the older kids, the equivalent reward might be pocket money or phone top-up. For the youngest kid, it might be sweets. It is up to the Tribe Leader to ensure the rewards are roughly equal in value. All tribe members can view what rewards (for both themselves and other tribe members) are available for each level on a given week.



# Features

## Tasks and Rewards
Tribe leaders can create tasks for the tribe members. Tribe leaders complete these tasks to earn points.

When points are accumulated, rewards can be unlocked. For example, a weekly reward (set by a tribe leader) might be a certain amount of pocket money. If the tribe members earn enough points in the week in question they receive the pocket money.

Points earning is done as a group.

Tasks can be once-off or recurring, eg. daily tasks ("do homework") or weekly tasks ("take out bins"). Bonus points are available for certain recurring tasks if a set amount are completed several days in a row or every day in a week.

Sample rewards for kids are

* amounts of pocket money (a multiplier system is available to award appropriate levels of pocket money based on the kids' ages)
* phone top-up credit
* presents (eg. a toy, new phone)

Tribe has a selection of default rewards to choose from, however the Tribe leaders have the option to customise the rewards.

## Categories
Tasks can fit into a category.

Information about how many points have been scored in a certain category are available, giving the Tribe an idea of where they are doing well and where improvements are needed.

Tribe provides several categories by default:

* Household
* Diet
* Fitness
* Pets
* Learning and School

## Shared Calendar
Tasks show up on a calendar which all Tribe Members can access. This enables members to see what other members are doing on a given day.
